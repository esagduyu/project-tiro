# Tiro

**A local-first reading OS for the AI age.**

Tiro saves web pages and email newsletters as clean markdown on your machine, enriches them with AI-extracted tags, entities, and summaries, and uses Claude Opus 4.6 for deep cross-document reasoning — daily digests that find contradictions between sources, trust analysis on demand, and learned reading preferences that adapt to you.

Named after Cicero's freedman who preserved and organized his master's works for posterity, Tiro does the same for your digital knowledge.

*Built solo for the [Built with Opus 4.6: a Claude Code Hackathon](https://cerebralvalley.ai/e/claude-code-hackathon) (Feb 10–16, 2026) — a week-long virtual hackathon by Anthropic and Cerebral Valley celebrating one year of Claude Code.*

## Why Tiro?

- **Local-first** — Your data lives on your machine as plain markdown files, SQLite, and ChromaDB. No cloud, no lock-in.
- **Model-agnostic data layer** — Content stored in open formats, portable and usable with any AI.
- **Opinionated intelligence** — Opus 4.6 generates ranked digests, clusters articles by topic and entity, and flags bias and unsourced claims.
- **Minimal friction** — One command to run, clean distraction-free reader UI, full keyboard navigation.
- **Own your context** — One-click export of your entire library as portable markdown + JSON.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esagduyu/project-tiro.git
cd project-tiro
uv sync                       # creates venv + installs all dependencies
uv run tiro init              # creates library, prompts for API key
uv run tiro run               # starts server at localhost:8000, opens browser
```

That's it. Save your first article by pasting a URL into the inbox.

> **Tip:** If you use `direnv`, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your `.envrc` instead of adding it to config.yaml.
>
> **Note:** All `tiro` commands should be run with `uv run tiro` so they execute inside the project's virtual environment.

## Features

### Ingestion

- **Save web pages** — Paste a URL, get a clean markdown article with extracted metadata
- **Import emails** — Drag .eml files or bulk import a directory of newsletters
- **Chrome extension** — One-click save from any browser tab (see [Chrome Extension](#chrome-extension) below)
- **Auto-enrichment** — Haiku extracts tags, named entities, and a 2-3 sentence summary on every save

### Intelligence (Opus 4.6)

- **Daily digest** — Three digest variants: ranked by importance, grouped by topic, grouped by entity. Opus finds contradictions between sources, connects threads, and surfaces insights you'd miss.
- **Ingenuity analysis** — On-demand bias detection, factual confidence scoring, and novelty assessment for any article. Only runs when you ask (saves tokens).
- **Learned preferences** — Rate a few articles, and Opus classifies the rest into must-read / summary-enough / discard tiers based on your demonstrated taste.

### Reading

- **Clean reader** — Distraction-free article view with full markdown rendering
- **Semantic search** — Find articles by meaning, not just keywords
- **Related articles** — Auto-computed on save with AI-generated connection notes
- **Content decay** — Unengaged articles naturally fade from digests over time

### Productivity

- **Keyboard-first** — Full `j`/`k`/`Enter`/`Esc` navigation, ratings with `1`/`2`/`3`, shortcuts overlay with `?`
- **Reading stats** — Charts showing articles saved/read, top topics, source engagement, reading streak
- **Export** — Download your entire library as a portable zip (markdown files + metadata JSON)
- **MCP server** — Query your library from Claude Desktop or Claude Code

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `uv run tiro init` | Initialize library, create databases, prompt for API key |
| `uv run tiro run` | Start server at localhost:8000 and open browser |
| `uv run tiro run --no-browser` | Start server without opening browser |

| `uv run tiro-mcp` | Start the MCP server (for Claude Desktop/Code integration) |

---

## Chrome Extension

A minimal "Save to Tiro" Chrome extension lives in the `extension/` directory.

### Features

- Shows the current page title and URL before saving
- Detects if the URL is already saved — shows "Already in your library" with a link
- Optional VIP toggle to mark the source as a favorite
- Success confirmation with article title, source, and "Open in Tiro" link
- Error state if the Tiro server isn't running

### Installation

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser)
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension/` directory from this repo
5. The Tiro icon (blue circle with white "T") appears in your toolbar

> The Tiro server must be running at `localhost:8000` for the extension to work.

## MCP Server — Connect Tiro to Claude

Tiro includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes your reading library to Claude Desktop and Claude Code.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_articles(query)` | Semantic search across your library |
| `get_article(article_id)` | Full article content and metadata |
| `get_digest(digest_type)` | Today's daily digest (ranked, by_topic, by_entity) |
| `get_articles_by_tag(tag)` | Articles filtered by topic tag |
| `get_articles_by_source(source)` | Articles filtered by source name or domain |
| `save_url(url)` | Save a web page to your library |
| `save_email(file_path)` | Save an .eml newsletter to your library |

### Claude Code

Add to your project's `.mcp.json` (or `~/.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tiro": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/project-tiro", "tiro-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config file:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tiro": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/project-tiro", "tiro-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/project-tiro` with the actual path to your clone, and add your Anthropic API key.

---

## Export

Export your entire library (or a filtered subset) as a portable zip bundle:

```bash
uv run tiro export --output my-library.zip
uv run tiro export --output ai-articles.zip --tag ai
uv run tiro export --output favorites.zip --rating-min 1
```

The zip contains:
- `articles/` — All markdown files with YAML frontmatter intact
- `metadata.json` — Full structured data (articles, sources, tags, entities, relations)
- `README.md` — Bundle format documentation

Also available via the API (`GET /api/export`) and the Export button on the Stats page.
